# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1)
##### Scrabble like game

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished challenge 1

**Thoughts:**  I've used list comprehensions on most of the functions. I was unable to complete this challenge today due to tiredness from work and for being awake for 17 hours.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018 (Pybites challenge 3)
##### Blog Tag Analysis, Datacamp, First steps to machine learning

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 03, completed one tutorial on "first-steps to machine learning"

**Thoughts:**  I've learned the importance of sorting things before doing something else with them. My code kept failing the test, I had to check the solution and saw that the problem was not sorting the pair before checking for similarity. I've also practised pandas on Datacamp and completed the tutorial [first-steps to machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 04, started the course Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build An AI

**Thoughts:**  Finished pybites challenge 04 - had issues with the tests so had to modify them, it might be an issue so submitted a PR to fix this. Started new course on how to build AI, have a lot of papers to read but the course seems pretty amazing!

**Link to work:** [Pybites-04](/day-4/Pybites-04/usertweets.py)

### Day 5: January 8, 2018 (Studying)
##### Twitter data analysis Part 1: Getting Data, Course on AI, 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on pybites challenge 5. Read chapter 3 of Mastering Python and studied two papers: _Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction_ and  _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Had a long day at work so the little downtime I had I used to read about python and prepare my knowledge for the Course: Build an AI.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018 (Fixed issues in PRs)
##### Fixed issues in PRs raised by me on opsdroid and uplink

**Today's Progress**: Fixed almost everything on the PR in opsdroid. Read about the `@property` decorator.

**Thoughts:**  Had another long day so I had about 2 hours free after work. Spend that time working on pull requests and reading about the `@property` decorator in order to use it in one of the PRs.


### Day 7: January 10, 2018 (Study and Opsdroid)
##### Fixed issues in a PR (opsdroid), studied a paper

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the property decorator to `opsdroid.connector`, worked out kinks in the PR and created a rudimentary test for new methods on the Messenger class. Studied the paper _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Unit testing still baffles me a bit. It usually takes a long while for me to think and implement basic testing cases. I've read the paper on Markov Decision Processes and studied Bellman Equations.

### Day 8: January 11, 2018 (Building an AI Course, NLTK)
##### Did one lesson on Building an AI, started playing with NLTK

**Today's Progress**: Updated documentation for Opsdroid's Connectors, finished reading the paper _Markov Decision Processes_ and did one lesson on Building an AI. Played around with the NLTK module

**Thoughts:**  I've enjoyed playing around with NLTK and I'm eager to do more stuff with it. I'm hoping to get enough knowledge to work on Pybites challenge 5 and use tweepy and NLTK together.

### Day 9: January 12, 2018 (NLTK and Book: Mastering Python)
##### Played around with NLTK, fixed opsdroid PR, read chapter 4 of Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Catch up with my growing list of unlisted episodes of my podcasts. Read chapter 4 of Mastering Python, played with NLTK and worked on opsdroid PR.

**Thoughts:**  I spent a lot of time trying to make unit tests passing when mocking the `asyncio.sleep()` function. I've also done a lot of reading and that makes me feel that today wasn't as productive as it should be.

### Day 10: January 13, 2018 (NLTK, opsdroid PR and new skill)
##### Played around with NLTK again, worked on opsdroid PR, created skill-words for opsdroid

**Today's Progress**:  Created a new skill for opsdroid which uses my knowledge of NLTK so far. Finished opsdroid PR that adds typing/thinking delays, tests and documentation.

**Thoughts:**  Today was great, it was fun to implement NLTK with opsdroid. I've also finished working on the typing/thinking delay PR. Along with that I played with my Arduino and finished project 5 from the book that comes with the starter kit.

**Link to work:** [Opsdroid Skill: words](https://github.com/opsdroid/skill-words),  [Opsdroid PR - typing/thinking delay](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/pull/376)

### Day 11: January 14, 2018 (Opsdoird skill - words)
##### Updated documentation and the translation function of Opsdroid skill - words

**Today's Progress**:  Updated the translation function to accept translations from one language into another(before it would only translate from English), updated the documentation related to this function.

**Thoughts:**  Today's work was a very quick one and the rest of the day was spent with my fiance. Will do some reading of the book Mastering Python in order to catch up with my hour of code.

**Link to work:** [Opsdroid Skill: words](https://github.com/opsdroid/skill-words)

### Day 12: January 15, 2018 (PR in Opsdroid, Pybites, NLTK)

**Today's Progress**:  Attempted fixing an issue in Opsdroid, read more about NLTK and watched a bunch of videos on it. Started working on challenge 5 of Pybites.

**Thoughts:**  I've updated my blog by adding the project - Opsdroid skill words. I've been watching and reading stuff about NLTK and started writing tests for the pybites challenge 5.

**Link to work:** [Blog post](https://fabiorosado.github.io/projects/opsdroid-skill-words/), [Pybites challenge 5](https://pybit.es/codechallenge05.html)

### Day 13: January 16, 2018 (Unit Tests)
##### Tests for Opsdroid PR

**Today's Progress**:  Spent the whole day trying to find a way to test a try/except block in Opsdroid. Worked a bit on Pybites challenge 05

**Thoughts:**  Today has been somewhat frustrating as every new attempt at passing the tests failed.  I've also struggled with Pybites challenge 05.

### Day 14: January 17, 2018 (Pybites, NLTK)
##### Finish Pybites 05 challenge, bites 5 and 8, NLTK

**Today's Progress**:  Spent a few hours working on Pybites challenge 05, got some reasonable results compared to the solutions, studied more about NLTK.

**Thoughts:**  I'm not 100% happy with the code that I came up with the Pybites challenge, the code takes a while to run and it doesn't look very good. 
Although, I'm happy that I got a close enough result compared to the solution and that all I used was mostly the NLTK library.

**Link to work:** [Pybites Challenge 05](day-14/Pybites-05/tweets.py)

### Day 15: January 18, 2018 (Reading, Building an AI, Challenges)
##### Read more of chapter 5 of Mastering Python. Watched lessons on Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  I did a lot of reading and watching explanations on Building an AI. Since I didn't do any coding, I've completed bite 2 and one codewars challenge (which was too easy).

**Thoughts:**   I've read a bit more about using NLTK in sentiment Analysis for Pybites challenge 7. Today I have almost finished the introductory chapter of Building an AI, can't wait to get into code!

**Link to work:** [Challenge - Bite 2](day-15/bite-2.py), [Challenge - CodeWars](day-15/codewars-count-characters.py)

### Day 16: January 19, 2018 (NLTK, Pybites, Building an AI)
##### Read about sentiment analysis in NLTK, finished intro to Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  Spent a lot of time figuring out how to do sentiment analysis in NLTK. Finished intro to Building an AI and worked on Pybites challenge 07.

**Thoughts:**   It was a bit frustrating learning about sentiment analysis since I was unable to get good results. Started working on Pybites challenge 07 but I'm not happy with what I came up with.

### Day 17: January 20, 2018 (NLTK, Building an AI)
##### Played with the sentiment analysis classifier, watched a few lessons on Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  Didn't do much today because of work and family time. Was able to do a few lessons on the course building and ai, read a bit from the book Mastering Python 

**Thoughts:**   I'm trying to play around with the classifier to get a good accuracy rating on the sentiment analysis so I could use it on the Pybites challenge 7. 
The classifier was returning only a negative, tried NLTK Vader's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, but was returning mostly neutral sentiments. Will need to search more on this matter 
to find a way to implement a good sentiment analyser.

### Day 18: January 21, 2018 (Pybites challenge 07, Mastering Python)
##### Pybites challenge 07 - 99% done, Book: Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**:  Finished most of Pybites challenge 07, just need to tweak things a bit to tidy up tweets better. Read about decorators and class methods(property, staticmethod, etc).

**Thoughts:**  Overall I'm quite happy with what I came up with on this 7th challenge. It's not as short as the one in the solutions, but I decided not to use the textblob library, so had to kind off reinvent to wheel,
comparing to the solutions I'm getting a 66% of positive feedback on the movie "The Darkest Hour", compared with 53% obtained from the solution - this difference is mostly due to the fact that my code doesn't classify a neutral sentiment.
I've also learned how to prevent the classifier to keep training on ever iteration - all I had to do was to invoke that function in the class `__init__`.

**Link to work:** [Pybites challenge 07](day-18/Pybites-07/sentiment.py)

### Day 19: January 22, 2018 (Pybites challenge 07, Tweet Scrapper, dataset)
##### Pybites challenge, extend dataset

**Today's Progress**:  Tweaked Pybites challenge 07, just need to accept terms from the terminal and it will do, searching for datasets to improve the classifier.

**Thoughts:**  Got a good dataset from [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/) to try and improve the classifier. Tried to clean the data without speeding down the classifier. 
Created a tweet scrapper to classify tweets using TextBlob to classify tweets and save them in different files so they can be used in training the classifier.

### Day 20: January 23, 2018 (Pybites challenge 07, Tweetnalytic, exercism challenge)
##### Pybites challenge, Reading: Mastering Python, new project - Tweetnalytic

**Today's Progress**:  Read about asyncio to try and improve run speed on the classifier. All my attempts failed so I reduced the dataset size - it didn't affect the classifier accuracy much. 
Finally finished challenge 07. Created a new project called tweetnalytic that contains the classifier and twitter interaction with the API. Read more about decorators and finished off with an exercise from exercism.

**Thoughts:**  Playing around with the Twitter API was fun, started a new project to kind off merge my solutions of Pybites challenge 07 and 05. Today I had the proof that I don't understand asycio yet. 
My attempt to turn the classifier into an asynchronous object failed, will keep on reading and experimenting until I find a way to do it properly and then use it in my code.

### Day 21: January 24, 2018 (Pybites challenge 08)
##### Pybites challenge, Reading: Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Pybites challenge 08 and read more about generators from the book Mastering Python.

**Thoughts:**  Today I was feeling tired so I didn't do much. Managed to finish Pybites challenge 8, this challenge was fun and easy. Made an ascii like version of the app. 
This uses an insane amount of print statements and if/else blocks. Did some reading on generators as well.

##### opsdroid, freecodecamp 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my PR (adding no-dep flag), wrote a new test and was stuck for a while until I managed to get it green. Finished the course on JQuery on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:**  Today I spent most of the day working on opsdroid, creating a test that passed consumed some of my morning. Then, I tried to figure out why opsdroid wasn't replying to commands, in the end I had to play around with git and previous versions to pin-point where the issue was, I tried to work around to make opsdroid work without a module, in the end I just revered the changed of a PR as a temporary solution.

### Day 46: February 28, 2018 (opsdroid, Datacamp )
##### opsdroid, Datacamp 

**Today's Progress**: Was trying to figure out why opsdroid was broken. In the end the  solution was fond by opsdroid founder (Jacob Tomlinson).  Did some exercises in Datacamp's course - Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python.

##### opsdroid, freecodecamp, Datacamp, Tutorial: Scotch.io

**Today's Progress**: Finished first project on freecodecamp. Came around with a quick fix for an issue on opsdroid, started playing around with Vue. Trained a bit more of regex on Datacamp.

**Thoughts:**  Today was a fun day. Finished the first project on freecodecamp, building a simple tribute page. I've also started playing around with vue and seems like a fun thing to do.

**Links:** [Build a Blog With Vue, GraphQL, and Apollo Client
](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-blog-with-vue-graphql-and-apollo-client#enabling-cors) [freecodecamp - Tribute page](https://codepen.io/FabioRosado/full/gvZpVd/)

### Day 48: March 2, 2018 (opsdroid)
##### opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Submitted a PR to opsdroid fixing an issue and also created a test for the quick fix which didn't increase the coverage.

**Thoughts:**  Didn't do much coding today because I came home quite tired from work. I was able to submit a PR and reply to some questions on opsdroid. 

### Day 49: March 8, 2018 (Codecademy, Scotch.io)
##### Codecademy - Javascript, Scotch.io - Getting started with Vue

**Today's Progress**: Started a course on Vue framework. After doing the introduction exercise (creating hello world) I decided to get some basics on Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I can see the similarities between Python and Javascript and my knowledge of Python comes in handy when trying to pick up another language. Currently the javascript course on codecademy is 24% done, I'm eager to get back and try things with Vue as it seems a nice thing to know and play with.

### Day 50: March 9, 2018 (Codecademy)
##### Codecademy - Javascript, 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating functions on Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Today was a very slow day, but learned about the different ways to create a function in Javascript, all the different ways seems a bit confusing. With practice I'll probably ge the hang of it.

### Day 51: March 11, 2018 (Codecademy, freecodecamp)
##### Codecademy - Javascript, 

**Today's Progress**:Continued the course about javascript on codecademy. Started doing project 2 from codecademy - create a single page portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I've started playing around with bulma.io I really like it so far and love the color scheme of it. I'm trying to code a portfolio a bit different than my actual one.

### Day 52: March 13, 2018 (Datacamp, opsdroid)
##### Datacamp, opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Started the day by testing opsdroid-audio and see if my fix for reading links worked. Worked on the Natural Language Processing course on Datacamp.

**Thoughts:**  Had issues with anaconda replacing python3 path, this took a while for me to fix. Then the opsdroid-audio didn't work due to snowboydetect issue so I spent another long time trying to find a fix for it - it was unsuccessful. Got an introduction to gensim in Datacamp's course and decided that I should play around with it more. 

### Day 53: March 14, 2018 (Datacamp, codecademy)
##### Datacamp, codecademy

**Today's Progress**: Finished the course on Natural Language Processing and wrote a classifier that checks if an article is fake/real news. Studied more of javascript on codecademy.

**Thoughts:** Creating the classifier was quite fun and made me think that perhaps I should use the sklearn to improve my tweet analytics classifier. 

**Links:** [Datacamp - Fake News Classifier](day-53/fakenews.py)

### Day 54: March 15, 2018 (Codecademy, Book: Mastering Python)
##### Codecademy, Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Learned about iterators in javascript. Read the chapter about using Sphinx to generate documentation on the book Mastering Python.

**Thoughts:** Iterators in javascript seem a bit harder to master than ones in Python mostly due to the various ways to use them. Practice makes perfect and I've tried a few different approaches on codecademy.

### Day 55: March 16, 2018 (Codecademy)
##### Codecademy

**Today's Progress**: Learned  about creating objects and classes in Javascript. Practiced creating classes as much as possible.

**Thoughts:**  Creating a class in Javascript is different than Python so I took some time to practice the exercises and try to get into it. This lesson also helped me understand python classes better.

### Day 56: March 17, 2018 (Codecademy, freecodecamp)
##### Codecademy, freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Javascript course on codecademy. Started working on the second project of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:**  I've enjoyed the last part of the javascript code in codecademy, I've learned a bit more about making requests with javascript and how to create an url shortener like bit.ly

### Day 57: March 18, 2018 (scotch.io, freecodecamp)
##### scotch.io, freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the template for freecodecamp project 2, played around with Vue and followed the tutorial on scotch.io.

**Thoughts:**  Now that I have the basics of Javascript I can understand the workings of Vue much better. I like how simple and easy things seem to be when using the Vue framework.

### Day 58: March 20, 2018 (opsdroid, freecodecamp)
##### opsdroid, freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Spend some time updating a script for maintainers of opsdroid. Once that was done I've decided to update the script a bit further to include connectors and parsers - this is a work in progress. I've also tweaked a bit the layout of the project 2 of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** Working with file paths was a bit confusing at first because I was getting different results when running the script in pycharm and in the command line. In the end I've understood the issue and fixed it. Working with bulma css has been quite fun.

### Day 59: March 21, 2018 (opsdroid)
##### opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day refactoring the maintainers script to include more modules other than skills.

**Thoughts:** Refactoring took me a while because I was trying to understand the script better in order to work around it. It's currently 90% done but will need to finish it later and test it, hopefully everything will go okay.

### Day 60: March 31, 2018 (Bean-Intel)
##### Project: Bean-Intel

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a project to parse chat logs from Eve Online intel channels and return useful information.

**Thoughts:**  It has been a while since I have done any real coding, most of the things I have been doing was opsdroid maintainer stuff. I've also came with an idea to create a program that could parse the intel channel logs from the game Eve Online and return useful information, I am currently working on it now and it's been fun to play with regex and have a project that could help other gamers.

### Day 61: April 1, 2018 (Bean-Intel, Opsdroid)
##### Project: Bean-Intel, Opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the project Bean-Intel - improved the function parse_intel and created a way to read the last line of the log file(which is updated with every new message in game). Helped someone getting started with opsdroid and attempted to fix an issue with the shell connector.

**Thoughts:**  Reading from an ever changing txt file was a challenge but I was able to only keep the last line(the newest) and use it to parse intel, it worked better than expected. I was also able to read from a link and get intel from there - spent a lot of time tweaking things. It was also fun to try and fix an issue with the connector shell - windows cannot run the pwd module thats used to get the user name so had to use os.environ instead.

### Day 62: April 8, 2018 (Opsdroid, freecodecamp)
##### freecodecamp, Opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Updated my PR to fix a bug on a feature that I have implemented to opsdroid in the past. Worked on freecodecamp portfolio layout.

**Thoughts:**  I've forgot to add days to this log so I started from now (although my github shows some progress). The layout is almost done and I'm quite happy with it at the moment.

### Day 63: April 9, 2018 (freecodecamp)
##### freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the freecodecamp portfolio, finished 99% of it.

**Thoughts:**  I've used mostly bulma modules and glued them together, the layout looks neat though and Im enjoying this Bulma css.

### Day 64: April 10, 2018 (freecodecamp, The Odin Project)
##### freecodecamp, The Odin Project

**Today's Progress**: Finished the portfolio. Started the javascript course in freecodecamp and the first part of the odin project.

**Thoughts:**  Today was fun did a lot of reading and didn't do much. This part of freecodecamp is quite easy since I have done the codecademy course on javascript, I have also noticed that the freecodecamp course seems to be a bit outdated, but its too early to say.

### Day 65: April 11, 2018 (freecodecamp, The Odin Project, Mastering Python, Blog)
##### freecodecamp, The Odin Project, Mastering Python, Blog

**Today's Progress**: Read about documentation libraries in Python, updated my blog with a post, did 10 exercises on javascript in freecodecamp, read about command line on the odin project.

**Thoughts:**  The blog post was ready for ages but forgot to publish it. Didn't enjoy doing the javascript exercises in freecodecamp because they were too easy. I learned new flags for a few command line commands.

### Day 66: April 12, 2018 (The Odin Project, Mastering Python)
##### The Odin Project, Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Watched a few videos about using the command line, read about it on viking code skill and read more on documentation on the book Mastering python.

**Thoughts:**  Today I didn't have time to code so I decided to just watch the videos and do a bit of reading.

### Day 67: April 14, 2018 (The Odin Project, Mastering Python)
##### The Odin Project, Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Read a bit more about documentation on the book Mastering Python. Read more about the command line, installed rails and created an heroku account.

**Thoughts:**  Installed zsh on iterm and tried a few themes. Since I couldn't do much today due to work so instead I have created a schedule for tomorrow so I could thick those boxes out and do some productive work.

### Day 66: April 15, 2018 (Codecademy, the odin project)
##### Codecademy, the odin project

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading/watching the articles on the command line. Attempted to deploy one rails application through heroku, finished the codecademy course on git.

**Thoughts:** Followed the instructions but the app keeps crashing on heroku, will give it a go with a python application and see how it will work.


### Day 67: April 16, 2018 (The odin project, freecodecamp, blog, heroku)
##### The odin project, freecodecamp, blog, heroku

**Today's Progress**: Did about 30 javascript exercises on freecodecamp. Finished all modules on the odin project related to html - just the project needs to be done. Updated the blog with a project (Tweetnalytics) and did the getting started with python in heroku.

**Thoughts:** Understood why my yesterday's attempt at deploying an app failed - forgot to run the scale command. Practiced more on javascript some exercises had to make me thing but they remain pretty easy so far.

### Day 68: April 17, 2018 (The odin project, freecodecamp, Mastering Python, opsdroid)
##### The odin project, freecodecamp, Mastering Python, opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Did a few exercises in freedocecamp. Finished the project from the odin project in which we needed to create a google landing page. Started reading the chapter on testing from the book: _Mastering Python_. Submitted a PR to opsdroid to start using appdirs.

**Thoughts:** Creating the google landing page from scratch was quite fun and I have learned a lot. Started working on an issue on opsdroid that asked to use appdirs - a library that helps in determining which dirs to use depending on the platform used. Worked more on Javascript on freecodecamp.

### Day 69: April 18, 2018 (freecodecamp, opsdroid)
##### freecodecamp, opsdroid

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on opsdroid PR. Did some exercises on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I' sick so didn't do much today. I found an awesome list for podcasts and subscribed to a few podcasts today.

**Links:** [Awesome List - podscasts](https://github.com/FabioRosado/awesome-podcasts)


### Day 70: April 19, 2018 (opsdroid)
##### opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my PR and read the documentation of the python library click. 

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately I didn't progressed much on the PR today as my attempts at reading additional arguments from a command failed. 

### Day 71: April 21, 2018 (opsdroid, freecodecamp)
##### opsdroid, freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Finished most of the PR for opsdroid, started working on tests. Did a few exercises in freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:**  I was quite happy with my work on the PR so far, I have also written an introduction to vim for the documentation since we are choosing vim as a default editor if the user doesn't have one set.


### Day 72: April 22, 2018 (opsdroid)
##### opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Tried a few approaches on creating a test for a function that does a lot of things, it didn't go well.

**Thoughts:**  At the moment I am unsure how to test the function that I created that moves the config file to another location and does a few checks before deleting the file, the issue mostly is due to the fact that I use const variables for the path.

### Day 73: April 23, 2018 (opsdroid)
##### opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Updated documentation on opsdroid, updated a few tests and linting issues.

**Thoughts:** Today I wasn't feeling very well so I didn't do much, will try to make up for it tomorrow.

### Day 74: April 24, 2018 (opsdroid, blog)
##### opsdroid, blog

**Today's Progress**: Updated the documentation on vim and added it to my blog. Worked on the tests for the PR, did some refactoring on the function to accept path params and made a working test that keeps coverage at 100% and all new/previous tests pass.

**Thoughts:** Followed the suggestion of [Jacob Tomlinson](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson) and published the vim documentation on my personal blog after adding a few more bits to it in order to not be an exact copy of the documentation.  All tests passed and I'm finally happy with my Pull Request.

### Day 75: April 25, 2018 (opsdroid, Mastering Python, Freecodecamp)
##### opsdroid, Mastering Python, Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Got the PR merged into opsdroid main brach. Read more about tests on the book Mastering Python and working on some javascript exercises at freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying reading the book Mastering Python, might order the actual book from amazon and keep it close by when I need to brush on my knowledge. 


### Day 76: April 26, 2018 (Freecodecamp)
##### Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises in freecodecamp. Caught up on some of my to read list and podcasts.

**Thoughts:** Learned about objects and how thisCan[0].beA.Perfect[2].javascript.code Seems funny but that's probably because i come from Python.

### Day 77: April 27, 2018 (Freecodecamp)
##### Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Did more exercises on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** Almost finished the introduction to Javascript on freecodecamp.

### Day 78: April 28, 2018 (Freecodecamp, The Odin Project)
##### Freecodecamp, The Odin Project

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freecodecamp and finished the basic javascript course. At the same time I did some javascript exercises on the Odin Project.

**Thoughts:** Learning a new language is fun, I feel that I'm getting closer to that part in which I struggle to create something out of thin air before I become proficient on the language.

### Day 79: May 1, 2018 (Freecodecamp, The Odin Project, Podcasts, dev.to)
##### Freecodecamp, The Odin Project, Podcasts, dev.to

**Today's Progress**: Listened to a few podcasts today, did a few exercises in freecodecamp and will start the algorithms module, submitted my post about vim to dev.to.

**Thoughts:** It was good to be able to catch up with all my saved podcasts episodes. I also caught up with my reading list. Learned a bit more about Javascript and now will be interesting to apply that knowledge in the algorithm module.

### Day 80: May 2, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Writing an interpreter)
##### Freecodecamp, Writing an interpreter

**Today's Progress**: Did a few exercises in freecodecamp. Started working on building an interpreter by following a tutorial found online.

**Thoughts:** The building an interpreter post uses a TDD approach to the tasks and its been fun and challenging coming up with solutions for the failing tests so far.

**Links:** [A game of tokens: write an interpreter in Python with TDD](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2017/05/09/a-game-of-tokens-write-an-interpreter-in-python-with-tdd-part-1/)

### Day 81: May 3, 2018 (Freecodecamp, personal site)
##### Freecodecamp, personal site

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a few exercises on the algorithm module in freecodecamp. Fixed the image sizes from the posts in the homepage of my site.

**Thoughts:** Working on these exercises was quite fun since I used my knowledge of Python to try and solve these exercises.

**Links:** [Freecodecamp algorithms](day-81/freecodecamp-algorithms.js)

### Day 82: May 4, 2018 (Freecodecamp, The Odin Project)
##### Freecodecamp, The Odin Project

**Today's Progress**: Made the quick and easy exercises on functions for the odin project. Worked on the exercises on freecodecamp to truncate a string.

**Thoughts:** The truncating a string made me think a bit since some of the strings were failing until I figured up that the problem was a large number being used.

**Links:** [Freecodecamp Truncate String](day-82/freecodecamp-truncate-string), [The Odin Project Functions](day-82/the-odin-project-functions.js)

### Day 83: May 6, 2018 (Freecodecamp)
##### Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Did a few exercises on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the algorithm module on freecodecamp, I'm a bit disappointed that the exercises didn't contain some of the known algorithms that should be translated into javascript.

### Day 84: May 7, 2018 (Freecodecamp, blog posts, podcasts)
##### Freecodecamp, blog posts, podcasts

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the algorithm module on freecodecamp. Listened to some podcasts and read a few blog posts that were on my to read list.

**Thoughts:** Only one exercises to go in order for me to finish the algorithm course, just need to implement a Caesar Cipher in javascript, since I have done it before in Python this should be fairly easy to implement.

**Links:** [Freecodecamp algorithms](day-84/freecodecamp-algorithms-2.js)

### Day 85: May 10, 2018 (Freecodecamp, podcasts, cloudassessment, the odin project)
##### Freecodecamp, podcasts, cloudassessment, the odin project

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the Caesar Cipher challenge on freecodecamp, enrolled on the cloudassesment and started learning about aws. Started working on a project for the odin project in which we need to create a rock paper scissors game.

**Thoughts:** The Caesar cipher took me a bit to think through as I wanted to use the unicode chars and the charCodeAt(), fromCharCode() functions to get the deciphered letter. It was fun playing around on cloudassesment and I have learned something completely new and different than anything that I have used so far - the aws console is a bit scary with so much stuff that I have no idea what it does - but the challenges been fun to do and I am learning as I go. Finally, I have almost completed a game of rock paper scissors built on the console for the odin project. Overall, I'm quite pleased with today. 

### Day 86: May 11, 2018 (cloudassessment, the odin project)
##### cloudassessment, the odin project

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the quest on cloud assesment - S3 Security Basics and did a few activities to help me on the next quest - VPC Network Security. I've finished the rock paper scissors game for the odin project.

**Thoughts:** I tried to do the vpc network security quest but I'm a bit confused as to what I need to do so I might take the activities again and try to understand what the quest is asking of me. Building the rock, paper and scissors game was quite fun.

**Links:** [Rock, Paper Scissors Game](day-86/theodinproject-rpsgame.html)

### Day 87: May 13, 2018 (React, The Odin Project, Talk Python to me - MongoDB, bean-intel)
##### React, The Odin Project, Talk Python to me - MongoDB

**Today's Progress:** Followed a tutorial to build a Game of Life in React. Read about keeping code clean for The Odin Project, started the freecourse on MongoDB from Talk Python to me and working on the bean-intel project.

**Thoughts:** React got a bit confusing when I was following the tutorial, but I liked how you can mix html tags with javascript to get something done. I'm planning to create a database to keep track of used ships and systems visited for the bean-intel project.

**Links:** [Game of Life in React](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/create-gameoflife-with-react-in-one-hour-8e686a410174)

### Day 87: May 13, 2018 (The Odin Project, exercism javascript)
##### The Odin Project, exercism javascript

**Today's Progress:** Read articles for The odin project, did a few exercises on exercism with javascript.

**Thoughts:**  I'm feeling quite tired today so I didn't work as much as I should have, so I'm taking it easy and try to do some exercises on exercism.

### Day 88: May 17, 2018 (PR: Pandas)
##### PR: Pandas

**Today's Progress:** Submitted my first PR to Pandas implementing support for sphinx spelling extension.

**Thoughts:**  This was my first time working with Sphinx and on a project this big, it took me a while to wrap my head around things but I did some good progress.

### Day 89: May 18, 2018 (PR: Pandas)
##### PR: Pandas

**Today's Progress:** Fixed typos and added words to the wordlist that the Sphinx extension uses to whitelist terms

**Thoughts:**  The file for the whitelisted words is quite big at the moment and I have worked the whole day on fixing typos and adding terms. I've submitted all of them and now I'm waiting for a full review before marking the PR as ready.

### Day 90: May 19, 2018 (Aurelia)
##### Aurelia

**Today's Progress:** Read a bit about aurelia and did the first two tutorials on how to use it.

**Thoughts:**  One of the reasons why I decided to give aurelia a try was due to the fun example (creating a contact manager) and the cool layout of the website. It's a bit confusing to work with it at first but I can see how powerful the framework can be. I might take the contact manager example and expand its functionality. 

### Day 91: May 20, 2018 (Freecodecamp, The Odin Project)
##### Freecodecamp, The Odin Project

**Today's Progress:** Finished the module on JSON Apis and Ajax, started working on the first intermediate project - building a quote generator.

**Thoughts:**  I'm a little bit confused on how to use the JSON API and other APIS with javascript, I'll need to study and read more about it. I got a fun idea to implement the quote generator, it will be more work than needed but will be worth it. On the Odin Project I read about arrays in Javascript.

### Day 92: May 26, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Pandas, opsdroid, the odin project)
##### Freecodecamp, Pandas, opsdroid, the odin project

**Today's Progress:** Finished my prototype for the quote & weather project for the freecodecamp. Updated my PR for pandas and reviewed a PR in opsdroid.

**Thoughts:**  I'm excited to start working on the freecodecamp project I really like how the prototype looks and this will be my first time trying to make something out of a design. Read about TDD in javascript on the odin project and on dev.to site.

### Day 93: June 2, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Pandas, opsdroid, Sphinx spelling)
##### Freecodecamp, Pandas, opsdroid

**Today's Progress:** Updated the PR to pandas, merged the PR to opsdroid, submitted a documention PR to the Sphinx extension spelling, worked on freecodecamp challenges.

**Thoughts:**  Came back from holidays and it was good to go back to code. The freecodecamp got an update and they added quite a few new modules and challenges so I did some of them to try and catch up.

### Day 94: June 3, 2018 (Freecodecamp)
##### Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress:**  Worked on more challenges on freecodecamp - learning a bit more about CSS. Started build my quote generator/weather station.

**Thoughts:**  I had to go back to the css module to finish the challenges that have been added with the new update. I started working on the quote generator and weather station challenge, initially I used pure html & css to put things on the page but then realized that the design should be responsive, so I ended up adding bulma and had to fix most of the work done.

### Day 95: June 4, 2018 (Freecodecamp, pandas)
##### Freecodecamp, pandas

**Today's Progress:**  Tried a few things on how to update the contributor list for the pandas PR. Worked on the weather/quote project.

**Thoughts:**  Had some issues with css but managed to find the issue and fix it. Will start working on the javascript in order to get the weather working first - will need to get the data from the API and then change the values.

### Day 96: June 7, 2018 (Freecodecamp, pandas)
##### Freecodecamp, pandas

**Today's Progress:**  Got my PR merged into pandas. Will start working on the second part of it tomorrow, but started fixing some terms (mostly multi-index into MultiIndex). Worked on challenges on freecodecamp and read a bit on vue to try and create the quote/weather project.

**Thoughts:**  I'm still working with pandas but was happy that the PR got merged. I have been trying to update opsdroid but the build kept failing on multiple occasions and I'm unsure why.
