# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1)
##### Scrabble like game

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished challenge 1

**Thoughts:**  I've used list comprehensions on most of the functions. I was unable to complete this challenge today due to tiredness from work and for being awake for 17 hours.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1, opsdroid, Book)
##### Scrabble like game, Book: Mastering Python, PR: Opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 1 and 2. Read first 2 chapters of the book: Mastering Python. Submitted PR for opsdroid

**Thoughts**:  Very productive day, I've finished the first two challenges of Pybites, started reading the book Mastering Python and Submitted a PR to opsdroid for a WIP - Add typing/thinking delay to opsdroid.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018 (Pybites challenge 3)
##### Blog Tag Analysis, Datacamp, First steps to machine learning

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 03, completed one tutorial on "first-steps to machine learning"

**Thoughts:**  I've learned the importance of sorting things before doing something else with them. My code kept failing the test, I had to check the solution and saw that the problem was not sorting the pair before checking for similarity. I've also practiced pandas on datacamp and completed the tutorial [first-steps to machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).

### Day 4: January 7, 2018 (Pybites challenge 4)
##### Twitter data analysis Part 1: Getting Data, Course on AI, 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 04, started the course Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build An AI

**Thoughts:**  Finished pybites challenge 04 - had issues with the tests so had to modify them, it might be an issue so submitted a PR to fix this. Started new course on how to build AI, have a lot of papers to read but the course seems pretty amazing!

### Day 5: January 8, 2018 (Studying)
##### Twitter data analysis Part 1: Getting Data, Course on AI, 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on pybites challenge 5. Read chapter 3 of Mastering Python and studied two papers: _Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction_ and  _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Had a long day at work so the little down time I had I used to read about python and prepare my knowledge for the Course: Build an AI.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018 (Fixed issues in PRs)
##### Fixed issues in PRs raised by me on opsdroid and uplink

**Today's Progress**: Fixed almost everything on the PR in opsdroid. Read about the `@property` decorator.

**Thoughts:**  Had another long day so I had about 2 hours free after work. Spend that time working on pull requests and reading about the `@property` decorator in order to use it in one of the PRs.


### Day 7: January 10, 2018 (Study and Opsdroid)
##### Fixed issues in a PR (opsdroid), studied a paper

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the property  decorator to `opsdroid.connector`, worked out kinks in the PR and created a rudimentary test for new methods on the Messenger class. Studied the paper _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Unit testing still baffles me a bit. It usually takes a long while for me to think and implement basic testing cases. I've read the paper on Markov Decision Processes and studied Bellman Equations.

### Day 8: January 11, 2018 (Building an AI Course, NLTK)
##### Did one lesson on Building an AI, started playing with NLTK

**Today's Progress**: Updated documentation for Opsdroid's Connectors, finished reading the paper _Markov Decision Processes_ and did one lesson on Building an AI. Played around with the NLTK module

**Thoughts:**  I've enjoyed playing around with NLTK and I'm eager to do more stuff with it. I'm hoping to get enough knowledge to work on Pybites challenge 5 and use tweepy and NLTK together.

### Day 9: January 11, 2018 (NLTK and Book: Mastering Python)
##### Played around with NLTK, fixed opsdroid PR, read chapter 4 of Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Catch up with my growing list of unlisten episodes of my podcasts. Read chapter 4 of Mastering Python, played with NLTK and worked on opsdroid PR.

**Thoughts:**  I spent a lot of time trying to make unit tests passing when mocking the `asyncio.sleep()` function. I've also did a lot of reading and that makes me feel that today wasn't as productive as it should been.
