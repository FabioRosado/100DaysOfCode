# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1)
##### Scrabble like game

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished challenge 1

**Thoughts:**  I've used list comprehensions on most of the functions. I was unable to complete this challenge today due to tiredness from work and for being awake for 17 hours.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1, opsdroid, Book)
##### Scrabble like game, Book: Mastering Python, PR: Opsdroid

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 1 and 2. Read first 2 chapters of the book: Mastering Python. Submitted PR for opsdroid

**Thoughts**:  Very productive day, I've finished the first two challenges of Pybites, started reading the book Mastering Python and Submitted a PR to opsdroid for a WIP - Add typing/thinking delay to opsdroid.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018 (Pybites challenge 3)
##### Blog Tag Analysis, Datacamp, First steps to machine learning

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 03, completed one tutorial on "first-steps to machine learning"

**Thoughts:**  I've learned the importance of sorting things before doing something else with them. My code kept failing the test, I had to check the solution and saw that the problem was not sorting the pair before checking for similarity. I've also practiced pandas on datacamp and completed the tutorial [first-steps to machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).

### Day 4: January 7, 2018 (Pybites challenge 4)
##### Twitter data analysis Part 1: Getting Data, Course on AI, 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 04, started the course Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build An AI

**Thoughts:**  Finished pybites challenge 04 - had issues with the tests so had to modify them, it might be an issue so submitted a PR to fix this. Started new course on how to build AI, have a lot of papers to read but the course seems pretty amazing!

### Day 5: January 8, 2018 (Studying)
##### Twitter data analysis Part 1: Getting Data, Course on AI, 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on pybites challenge 5. Read chapter 3 of Mastering Python and studied two papers: _Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction_ and  _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Had a long day at work so the little down time I had I used to read about python and prepare my knowledge for the Course: Build an AI.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018 (Fixed issues in PRs)
##### Fixed issues in PRs raised by me on opsdroid and uplink

**Today's Progress**: Fixed almost everything on the PR in opsdroid. Read about the `@property` decorator.

**Thoughts:**  Had another long day so I had about 2 hours free after work. Spend that time working on pull requests and reading about the `@property` decorator in order to use it in one of the PRs.


### Day 7: January 10, 2018 (Study and Opsdroid)
##### Fixed issues in a PR (opsdroid), studied a paper

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the property  decorator to `opsdroid.connector`, worked out kinks in the PR and created a rudimentary test for new methods on the Messenger class. Studied the paper _Markov Decision Processes: Concepts and Algorithms_

**Thoughts:**  Unit testing still baffles me a bit. It usually takes a long while for me to think and implement basic testing cases. I've read the paper on Markov Decision Processes and studied Bellman Equations.

### Day 8: January 11, 2018 (Building an AI Course, NLTK)
##### Did one lesson on Building an AI, started playing with NLTK

**Today's Progress**: Updated documentation for Opsdroid's Connectors, finished reading the paper _Markov Decision Processes_ and did one lesson on Building an AI. Played around with the NLTK module

**Thoughts:**  I've enjoyed playing around with NLTK and I'm eager to do more stuff with it. I'm hoping to get enough knowledge to work on Pybites challenge 5 and use tweepy and NLTK together.

### Day 9: January 12, 2018 (NLTK and Book: Mastering Python)
##### Played around with NLTK, fixed opsdroid PR, read chapter 4 of Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**: Catch up with my growing list of unlisten episodes of my podcasts. Read chapter 4 of Mastering Python, played with NLTK and worked on opsdroid PR.

**Thoughts:**  I spent a lot of time trying to make unit tests passing when mocking the `asyncio.sleep()` function. I've also did a lot of reading and that makes me feel that today wasn't as productive as it should been.

### Day 10: January 13, 2018 (NLTK, opsdroid PR and new skill)
##### Played around with NLTK again, worked on opsdroid PR, created skill-words for opsdroid

**Today's Progress**:  Created a new skill for opsdroid which uses my knowledge of NLTK so far. Finished opsdroid PR that adds typing/thinking delays, tests and documentation.

**Thoughts:**  Today was great, it was fun to implement NLTK with opsdroid. I've also finished working on the typing/thinking delay PR. Along with that I played with my Arduino and finished project 5 from the book that comes with the starter kit.

### Day 11: January 14, 2018 (Opsdoird skill - words)
##### Updated documentation and the translation function of Opsdroid skill - words

**Today's Progress**:  Updated the translation function to accept translations from one language into another(before it would only translate from english), updated the documentation related to this function.

**Thoughts:**  Today's work was a very quick one and the rest of the day was spend with my fiance. Will do some reading of the book Mastering Python in order to catch up with my hour of code.

### Day 12: January 15, 2018 (PR in Opsdroid, Pybites, NLTK)
##### Created new PR in Opsdroid, read more about the NLTK library,

**Today's Progress**:  Attempted fixing an issue in Opsdroid, read more about NLTK and watched a bunch of videos on it. Started working on challenge 5 of Pybites.

**Thoughts:**  I've updated my blog by adding the project - Opsdroid skill words. I've been watching and reading stuff about NLTK and started writing tests for the pybites challenge 5.

### Day 13: January 16, 2018 (Unit Tests)
##### Tests for Opsdroid PR

**Today's Progress**:  Spent the whole day trying to find a way to test a try/except block in Opsdroid. Worked a bit on Pybites challenge 05

**Thoughts:**  Today has been somewhat frustrating as every new attempt at passing the tests failed.  I've also struggled with Pybites challenge 05.

### Day 14: January 17, 2018 (Pybites, NLTK)
##### Finish Pybites 05 challenge, bites 5 and 8, NLTK

**Today's Progress**:  Spent a few hours working on Pybites challenge 05, got some reasonable results compared to the solutions, studied more about NLTK.

**Thoughts:**  I'm not 100% happy with the code that I came up with Pybites challenge, the code takes a while to run and it doesn't look very good. 
Although, I'm happy that I got a close enough result compared to the solution and that all I used was mostly the NLTK library.

### Day 15: January 18, 2018 (Reading, Building an AI, Challenges)
##### Read more of chapter 5 of Mastering Python. Watched lessons on Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  I did a lot of reading and watching explanations on Building an AI. Since I didn't do any coding, I've completed bite 2 and one codewars challenge (which was too easy).

**Thoughts:**   I've read a bit more about using NLTK in sentiment Analysis for Pybites challenge 7. Today I have almost finished the introductory chapter of Building an AI, can't wait to get into code!

### Day 16: January 19, 2018 (NLTK, Pybites, Building an AI)
##### Read about sentiment analysis in NLTK, finished intro to Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  Spent a lot of time figuring out how to do sentiment analysis in NLTK. Finished intro to Building an AI and worked on Pybites challenge 07.

**Thoughts:**   It was a bit frustrating learning about sentiment analysis since I was unable to get good results. Started working on Pybites challenge 07 but I'm not happy with what I came up with.

### Day 17: January 20, 2018 (NLTK, Building an AI)
##### Played with the sentiment analysis classifier,watched a few lessons on Building an AI

**Today's Progress**:  Didn't do much today because of work and family time. Was able to do a few lessons on the course building and ai, read a bit from the book Mastering Python 

**Thoughts:**   I'm trying to play around with the classifier to get a good accuracy rating on the sentiment analysis so I could use it on the Pybites challange 7. 
The classifier was returning only a negative, tried NLTK Vader's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, but was returning mostly neutral sentiments. Will need to search more on this matter 
to find a way to implement a good sentiment analyser.

### Day 18: January 21, 2018 (Pybites challenge 07, Mastering Python)
##### Pybites challenge 07 - 99% done, Book: Mastering Python

**Today's Progress**:  Finished most of Pybites challenge 07, just need to tweak things a bit to tidy up tweets better. Read about decorators and class methods(property, staticmethod, etc).

**Thoughts:**  Overall I'm quite happy with what I came up with on this 7th challenge. It's not as short as the one in the solutions, but I decided not to use the textblob library, so had to kind off reinvent to wheel,
comparing to the solutions I'm getting a 66% of positive feedback on the movie "The Darkest Hour", compared with 53% obtained from the solution - this difference is mostly due to the fact that my code doesn't classify a neutral sentiment.
I've also learned how to prevent the classifier to keep training on ever iteration - all I had to do was to invoke that function in the class `__init__`.

### Day 19: January 22, 2018 (Pybites challenge 07, Tweet Scrapper, dataset)
##### Pybites challenge, extend dataset

**Today's Progress**:  Tweaked Pybites challenge 07, just need to accept terms from the terminal and it will done, searched for datasets to improve the classifier.

**Thoughts:**  Got a good dataset from [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/) to try and improve the classifier. Tried to clean the data without speeding down the classifier. 
Created a tweet scrapper to classify tweets using TextBlob to classify tweets and save them in different files so they can be used in training the classifier.
