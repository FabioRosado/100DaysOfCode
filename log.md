# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2018 (Pybites challenge 1)
##### Scrabble like game

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished challenge 1

**Thoughts:**  I've used list comprehensions on most of the functions. I was unable to complete this challenge today due to tiredness from work and for being awake for 17 hours.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018 (Pybites challenge 3)
##### Blog Tag Analysis, Datacamp, First steps to machine learning

**Today's Progress**: Finished Pybites challenge 03, completed one tutorial on "first-steps to machine learning"

**Thoughts:**  I've learned the importance of sorting things before doing something else with them. My code kept failing the test, I had to check the solution and saw that the problem was not sorting the pair before checking for similarity. I've also practiced pandas on datacamp and completed the tutorial [first-steps to machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).
