# 100 Days Of Code Part II - Log

### Day 1: 31st August, 2018 (Freecodecamp challenges)
##### Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles

**Today's Progress**: Review HTML 5 Accessibility and CSS3 principles

**Thoughts:**  Was good to review some of the old concepts and remember some that I have forgotten, I also understood what the `vw` means as size unit and also how to use it in css.

### Day 2: 1st September, 2018 (Python Data Structures and Algorithms)
##### Book: Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Today's Progress**: Started reading the book Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Went away for the weekend to visit friends so I didn't have my laptop with me, still managed to read a good bit of the first chapter before going to bed.

----

### Day 3: 2nd September, 2018 (Python Data Structures and Algorithms, dev.to)
##### Book: Python Data Structures and Algorithms, Articles: Dev.to

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles on dev.to in the morning, finished chapter 1 of Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Had to come back home, arrived a bit late so no I wasn't able to do any coding when I finally got home. I was able to finish the first chapter of the book before going to bed.

### Day 4: 3rd September, 2018 (Vue.JS, freecodecamp)
##### Tutorial: Fetching Data from a Third-Party API with Vue.js and Axios, Freecodecamp: Flexbox exercises

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the tutorial Fetching data from a third party API with vue and axios, also did a bunch of challenges on freecodecamp about flexbox. Saw some videos from the youtube channel [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse).

**Thoughts:**  Following the tutorial [Fetching Data from a Third-Party API with Vue.js and Axios](https://www.sitepoint.com/fetching-data-third-party-api-vue-axios/) was quite fun and learned a few things on how to use HTML and vue to dynamically change obtained results from an API. I have also thoroughly enjoyed learning more about flexbox on freecodecamp and would like to play around with it in some little project, I am still unsure what do do with it though.

### Day 5: 4th September, 2018 (Flexbox Froggy, Blog post, Wes Bos: Javascript30, Freecodecamp)
##### Flexbox Froggy, Blog post, Wes Bos: Javascript30, Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress**: Finished the challenges on flexbox both on freecodecamp and flexbox froggy. Wrote a blog post about Vue and geolocation, started watching the course from Wes Bos - Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**  Writing the blog was fun and quite simple to do, but checking everything worked took me a while. I was happy with what I have learned about flexbox and I'm eager to start working on Javascript30.

### Day 6: 5th September, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Javascript30)
##### Freecodecamp, Javascript30

**Today's Progress**: Finished the module on CSS Grid, did day 1 and 2 of Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**  CSS Grid was a bit confusing to understand and doesn't seem as straightforward as Flexbox, I will need to work more with it to understand it better. Working on day 1 of javascript 30 was fun, learned how to play a sound depending on keyboard presses.

### Day 7: 6th September, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Javascript30)
##### Freecodecamp, Javascript30

**Today's Progress**: Completed the day 3 of Javascript30. Worked on some javascript basic challenges that were added before after I completed the module.

**Thoughts:**  Tried to get mouse click to register on my console so I could add a trigger to update variables only when the mouse is clicked but it didn't work. On the good side I learned a bit more about CSS variables and how to use them.

### Day 8: 7th September, 2018 (Freecodecamp, Javascript30)
##### Freecodecamp, Javascript30

**Today's Progress**: Completed some basic exercises on Javascript, did day 4 of Javascript 30 and did a review on basics such as (map, filter, reduce,)

**Thoughts:**  Spend a lot of time playing Destiny 2 on PS4 so today wasn't as productive as I wanted it to be. Reviewed some javascript concepts and listened to some podcasts as well.

### Day 9: 8th September, 2018 (Python Data Structures and Algorithms)
##### Book: Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Today's Progress**: Was extremelty tired today so I wasn't able to spend time coding. To make up for it I read a bit of chapter 2 of the book Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Was a bit bummed that I wasn't able to code or follow Javascript 30 day 5.

---

### Day 10: 9th September, 2018 (Javascript 30, Opsdroid, Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms)
##### Javascript 30, Opsdroid, Coursera: Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms


**Today's Progress**: Finished day 5 of javascript 30. Accepted one PR to update docker and updated dependencies on opsdroid.

**Thoughts:**  Day 5 was extremelly interesting, we created an animated gallery using CSS Flex and a bit of javascript. Started a new course on Python - Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms

---

### Day 11: 10th September, 2018 (String processing and Pattern Matching Algorithms, Podcasts, Freecodecamp)
##### String processing and Pattern Matching Algorithms, Podcasts, Freecodecamp


**Today's Progress**: Finished the survey challenge for freecodecamp. Read the chapter on Naive String Mach algorithm and spent some hours working the pseudocode to make a python implementation of this algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I had to review a few concepts on python as I havent used it for a while now. Luckily it took me just a few minutes to get back up to speed with it. Was happy to implement a python version of the naive string matching algorithm on my own - but it could be improved further by using built in methods. The survey challenge was quite time consuming and spent a few hours working on it today. I also caught up with a few of my podcasts.

### Day 12: 11th September, 2018 (Project: Quote and Weather, Javascript30)
##### Project: Quote and Weather, Javascript30


**Today's Progress**: Fixed some issues with the project quote and weather and refactored the javascript. Finished day 6 of Javascript 30.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't very happy to have the VueJs app full of methods that should be inside the components, today I moved everything that was related to the weather to the weather component. The day 6 of Javascript 30 was extremely fun because it used a lot of the concepts that we have been learning and new ones such as regex.
