# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 31st August, 2018 (Freecodecamp challenges)
##### Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles

**Today's Progress**: Review HTML 5 Accessibility and CSS3 principles

**Thoughts:**  Was good to review some of old concepts and remember some that I have forgotten, I also understood what the `vw` means as size unit and also how to use it in css.

### Day 2: 1st September, 2018 (Python Data Structures and Algorithms)
##### Book: Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Today's Progress**: Started reading the book Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Went away for the weekend to visit friends so I didn't have my laptop with me, still managed to read a good bit of the first chapter before going to bed.

### Day 3: 2nd September, 2018 (Python Data Structures and Algorithms, dev.to)
##### Book: Python Data Structures and Algorithms, Articles: Dev.to

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles on dev.to in the morning, finished chapter 1 of Python Data Structures and Algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Had to come back home, arrived a bit late so no I wasn't able to do any coding when I finally got home. I was able to finish the first chapter of the book before going to bed.

### Day 4: 3rd September, 2018 (Vue.JS, freecodecamp)
##### Tutorial: Fetching Data from a Third-Party API with Vue.js and Axios, Freecodecamp: Flexbox exercises

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the tutorial Fetching data from a thrid party api with vue and axios, also did a bunch of challenges on freecodecamp about flexbox. Saw some videos from the youtube channel [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse).

**Thoughts:**  Following the tutorial [Fetching Data from a Third-Party API with Vue.js and Axios](https://www.sitepoint.com/fetching-data-third-party-api-vue-axios/) was quite fun and learned a few things on how to use html and vue to dynamically change obtained results from an API. I have also thoroughtly enjoyed learning more about flexbox on freecodecamp and would like to play around with it in some little project, I am still unsure what do do with it though.
